# LSTM-Stock-price
This code downloads the stock data for TCS from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library and applies a log function to convert the 'Close' column to a log-normal distribution. The log-normal data is then standardized using the StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing. The data is split into training and testing sets and a function is defined to create the dataset for the LSTM model. The training and testing datasets are created using the create_dataset function and then reshaped for the LSTM model. The LSTM model is defined with one layer of 50 LSTM units and one dense layer. The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss and the Adam optimizer. The model is then trained on the training data with 100 epochs and a batch size of 64. Predictions are made using the trained model on both the training and testing data. The predictions are then inverted back to the original scale and plotted against the actual closing price. Finally, the predictions are inverted from log-normal back to normal scale and plotted again against the actual closing price
